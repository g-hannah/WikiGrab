Format matrices in txt file format from TEX

Make list items more clear (i.e., " * content ...")

Do not re-format content in <pre></pre> tags because it heavily decreases readability of, for example, source code examples.

Check for bytes outwith the ASCII range, and add one byte of length for every pair in order that such a line is correctly justified.
